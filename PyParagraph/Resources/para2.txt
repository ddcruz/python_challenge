Some people love to bake. They'll make cookies, pies, or cakes. If, for example, they decide to bake a cake, they need to get some information about how to do it. For instance, if you decide to make a chocolate cake from scratch you might look for a recipe for that cake from a cookbook, use that recipe to find out what kind of ingredients you need, and then learn how to put the ingredients together in the correct order to make a perfect cake. A recipe, like the one you used to make the cake, is a good example of a non-literary text.
